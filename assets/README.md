# Game Assets Documentation

## Required Assets for Complete Implementation

### Car Sprites (PNG format with transparency)
- `player.png` - Player's car (red, 50x100px)
- `traffic1.png` - Traffic car type 1 (blue, 50x100px) 
- `traffic2.png` - Traffic car type 2 (green, 50x100px)
- `traffic3.png` - Traffic car type 3 (yellow, 50x100px)

### Road Textures
- `road.png` - Seamless road texture (2000x100px)
- `shoulder.png` - Road shoulder texture
- `background.png` - Scrolling background elements

### Audio Files (WAV/MP3 format)
- `engine.wav` - Engine acceleration sound
- `horn.wav` - Car horn sound
- `crash.wav` - Collision sound
- `music.mp3` - Background music

### Current Implementation
The game currently uses colored rectangles instead of sprites:
- Player car: Red rectangle
- Traffic cars: Blue rectangles
- Road: Gray background with white lane markers

To upgrade to using actual sprites, replace the drawing functions in game.js with image rendering code.
